Altinn Studio is used to create applications (apps).
An app can be everything from simple forms to large applications with both APIs and UI, and everything in between.

A new app is created from the Altinn Studio dashboard.

![The dashboard in Altinn Studio](overview.png "Dashboard - overview")

1. Click on the "**ny app**" button in the top right corner of the dashboard. 
2. Select the **owner** to create the app for. If you don't have access to any organisations, you'll need to select yourself.
3. Enter the **name** of the app. This name is used to identify the app, and is also used as repository name, in all URLs and in APIs.
   The name should be short and descriptive, like "sykemelding", or "lokalvalg-2019".  
    _The name cannot be changed once an app has been deployed to production._
4. Create the app by clicking "**Opprett**".

Once the app is created you will be redirected to the newly created app.
