## Text resources
Texts are stored in resource files in the app. Texts can come from common libraries, from the data model, or be added manually.
These texts are available when editing form UI component properties, and selected texts will be shown to the users.

## Add/edit texts for an app
In the top navigation menu, select _Spr√•k_ to go to the text editing page. 
An overview of the texts that are already available for the app is shown.

On this page, existing texts can be changed and new texts can be added.
Add a new text by clicking _Ny tekst_, and enter the text and a unique identifier for the text. 

Save any changes by clicking _Lagre tekster_.

For editing a lot of texts, a developer can also edit the texts as JSON directly in Altinn Studio Repos,
or locally in an editor after cloning the repo.
